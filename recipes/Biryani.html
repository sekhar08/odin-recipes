    <p>South Indian chicken biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originates from the southern region of India. It typically consists of fragrant, long-grain Basmati rice cooked with marinated chicken pieces, a blend of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves, and a mixture of sautéed onions, tomatoes, and green chilies. The dish is layered and cooked using the "dum" method, where it's slow-cooked on a low flame or in a sealed pot to allow the flavors to meld together. South Indian chicken biryani is known for its vibrant colors, rich flavors, and the use of ingredients like curry leaves, coconut milk, and sometimes saffron or turmeric, giving it a distinct regional twist compared to other biryani varieties in India. It's often served with raita (yogurt dip) or a side of spicy pickle to complement its taste.</p>

    <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong></li>
            <p>Mix chicken with yogurt, spices, ginger-garlic paste, and salt. Add lemon juice for extra flavor. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
            
           <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong></li>
            <p>Rinse and cook the Basmati rice with water and salt until it's 70-80% cooked. Drain and set aside.</p>

            <li><strong>Prepare Biryani Gravy:</strong></li>
             <p>Sauté sliced onions, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, and spices in ghee or oil until onions turn golden brown.
                Add tomatoes and cook until they soften. Add marinated chicken and cook until it's partially done.
                Layer with mint and coriander leaves.</p>

            <li><strong>Layer and Dum Cooking:</strong></li>
            <p>In a large heavy-bottomed pot, alternate layers of partially cooked rice and the chicken gravy mixture.
                Optionally, drizzle saffron milk on top.
                Seal the pot with foil or a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes to let flavors meld.</p>

            <li><strong>Serve Hot:</strong></li>
            <p>Gently fluff the layers with a fork.
                Garnish with fried onions, mint leaves, and coriander leaves.
